Build a mobile-first, minimalistic web app called "What they Got?" for college students who eat at the University Dining Center at Minnesota State University, Mankato (MNSU).
This is a student-run project, not affiliated with the university.

🎯 Purpose

Give students a one-stop social feed to:

Check today’s DC menu without navigating the official Sodexo site.

Rate and review menu items with stars, short text, and emojis.

Share photos of their plates and spot what’s actually bussin’.

⚡ Core Features (MVP)

Daily Menu Feed

Scrape https://mnsu.sodexomyway.com/en-us/locations/university-dining-center twice per day.

Capture: date, meal_period (breakfast/lunch/dinner), station, item_name, calories (if listed), and allergens.

Automatically update a public feed with no manual input.

Ratings & Reviews (Open)

Anyone can post a 1–5 star rating with optional text and emoji reactions.

Include lightweight anti-spam (rate-limit per device/IP, basic profanity filter).

Photo Uploads

Allow one image per review.

Provide basic moderation (flag system + admin dashboard to hide unsafe images).

Report Menu Issue

Simple button to flag incorrect menu info (ties to the specific item/date).

🌱 Nice-to-Have (if easy)

Calories Calculator: users select items to auto-sum calories using scraped data.

PWA Support: installable on phones with an app icon and offline cache for the last fetched menu.

Optional Digest: email or push notification when the new daily menu goes live.

🎨 Design & Vibe

Aesthetic: minimal + dope. Think black/charcoal background, white text, one bold accent (mint #6EE7B7 or violet #7C3AED).

Typography: modern sans like Inter or Space Grotesk.

Layout:

Home: “Today’s Menu” → cards grouped by meal period, horizontal swipe for stations.

Item Detail: calories, allergens, reviews thread, emoji reactions row, “Add Review” & “Report Issue” buttons pinned at bottom.

Admin Dashboard: simple list of flagged reviews/photos with toggle controls.

📊 Data Model

MenuItems: id, date, meal_period, station, item_name, calories, allergens, source_url, image_url (nullable), created_at

Reviews: id, menu_item_id (FK), rating, emoji (string/array), text, photo_url (nullable), device_id, is_flagged (bool), created_at

Reports: id, menu_item_id (FK), issue_text, device_id, status (open/resolved), created_at

ScrapeRuns (optional): id, started_at, status, items_added, errors

🛠️ Deployment & Automation

Use free-tier-friendly hosting (e.g., Supabase, Firebase, or built-in platform DB).

Set up a scheduled job (cron) to scrape and update the MenuItems table twice daily.

Provide one-click deploy or clear steps to run locally and on free hosting.

✅ Acceptance Criteria

On a phone, I can open the site, instantly see today’s menu, tap an item, and post a review (stars + text + emoji) with an optional photo.

Reports and flagged photos appear in the admin dashboard for moderation.

The scraper updates menu items automatically twice per day.

(If built) the calories calculator correctly sums selected items.
